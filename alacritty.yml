# Hints

#hints:
  # Keys used for the hint labels.
  #alphabet: "jfkdls;ahgurieowpq"

  # List with all available hints
  #
  # Each hint must have any of `regex` or `hyperlinks` field and either an
  # `action` or a `command` field. The fields `mouse`, `binding` and
  # `post_processing` are optional.
  #
  # The `hyperlinks` option will cause OSC 8 escape sequence hyperlinks to be
  # highlighted.
  #
  # The fields `command`, `binding.key`, `binding.mods`, `binding.mode` and
  # `mouse.mods` accept the same values as they do in the `key_bindings` section.
  #
  # The `mouse.enabled` field controls if the hint should be underlined while
  # the mouse with all `mouse.mods` keys held or the vi mode cursor is above it.
  #
  # If the `post_processing` field is set to `true`, heuristics will be used to
  # shorten the match if there are characters likely not to be part of the hint
  # (e.g. a trailing `.`). This is most useful for URIs and applies only to
  # `regex` matches.
  #
  # Values for `action`:
  #   - Copy
  #       Copy the hint's text to the clipboard.
  #   - Paste
  #       Paste the hint's text to the terminal or search.
  #   - Select
  #       Select the hint's text.
  #   - MoveViModeCursor
  #       Move the vi mode cursor to the beginning of the hint.
